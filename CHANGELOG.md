## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **The privileged helper no longer installs a blanket `NOPASSWD` sudoers rule.**
  One helper covering every privileged operation could only ever have one
  policy, so the rule granted any process running as the user passwordless
  root for all of them — including `renice-pid` against *any* PID on the
  system. It is replaced by three separate root-owned helpers under
  `/usr/local/lib/argus-lasso/`, each with its own polkit action:
  `cpu-park`, `power-profile` and `renice`. Installing removes
  `/etc/sudoers.d/argus-lasso` and the old helper. ([#30])
- **`renice` is confined to the caller's own processes.** It compares
  `PKEXEC_UID` against the owner of the target PID and refuses anything else,
  including when invoked outside pkexec where it cannot tell who is asking.
  ([#30])
- **Releases are verified with a minisign signature** before anything is
  written, against a public key compiled into the binary. The `.sha256` alone
  never established authenticity — it shipped from the same release as the
  tarball. ([#28])

  > The shipped `dist/argus-lasso.pub` is a placeholder. A build carrying it
  > refuses to self-install and says so; update checks still work. See
  > `docs/design-updates.md` before cutting a release.

- The root-password fallback for helper installation is gone. The helpers are
  authorised by polkit, so on a system without it they would have been
  installed and then permanently unusable — and the fallback put a plaintext
  password through the process for no benefit. ([#30])

### Fixed

- **The Settings scroll bar is visible**, so the last card stops looking cut
  off. The content is taller than the panel at the default window size, so it
  scrolls correctly — but egui's default bar floats in colours close to the
  page, so nothing signalled that scrolling was possible. ([#41])
- The window opacity slider was short and low-contrast, reading as an empty
  box followed by a number in the dark theme, and showed `1.000` where it
  means `100%`. ([#41])
- The update banner can be dismissed. ([#38])
- **Restarting into an update no longer strands parked CPUs.** "Restart now"
  exec'd straight over the process image, so `on_exit` never ran and the
  daemon never restored nice values, throttles or parked cores — and the
  originals live only in the replaced process's memory. ([#28])
- **Self-update refreshes the desktop entry, systemd unit and icons**, which
  previously stayed frozen at whatever version first installed them. Only
  files that already exist are rewritten. ([#28])
- **Disk I/O rates were wrong by the sampling cadence.** Raw byte deltas were
  labelled "bytes/s", so the figure read twice the real rate at the default
  500 ms interval. ([#29])
- **The dashboard cards no longer overflow the panel.** The KPI row's width
  arithmetic ignored `item_spacing`, pushing the ProBalance card off the right
  edge. ([#28])
- `argus-lasso --version` errored with "unexpected argument". ([#31])
- **The AUR package's systemd unit pointed at a path it never installed.** The
  package puts the binary in `/usr/bin` but shipped a unit with
  `ExecStart=%h/.local/bin/argus-lasso`, so the service failed to start. It
  also installed only the 256px icon, skipping the scalable and tiered small
  masters. ([#31])
- A `tar` archive containing two `argus-lasso` entries would have been spliced
  into one file and marked executable; the updater now refuses anything but a
  single match. ([#28])
- The update UI could wedge on "Checking for updates…" until restart if the
  worker thread died before reporting. ([#28])

### Performance

- **Idle CPU cut from 1.31% to 0.58% of a core** (578-process machine, 120 s
  windows). Process names and command lines are cached per PID instead of
  being re-read every pass; affinity, I/O priority and disk rates are sampled
  on the display cadence rather than the enforce cadence; an enforce pass with
  no rules and no default affinity no longer drives a `/proc` walk; and the
  published snapshot moved behind an `Arc` instead of being deep-cloned twice
  per display tick. ([#29])

### Changed

- **Round 4 of the design review**, covering all ten cross-cutting findings
  and the per-tab list: the Rules empty state and the rule dialog rebuilt
  against their mockups, the Benchmark tab's pre-run state, consistent apply-bar
  placement, card framing around the Processes plot row, and a dozen smaller
  corrections. ([#28])
- **The egui stack moves to 0.34.** `App::ui` replaces the deprecated
  `App::update` as the entry point, panels are shown with `show_inside`, and
  `show_viewport_immediate` hands its callback a `Ui` rather than a `Context` —
  so all seven dialogs changed with it. 0.34 also flips eframe's default
  renderer to wgpu; glow is now selected explicitly, since wgpu pulls a far
  larger tree and changes the surface eframe hands to the Wayland opacity
  code. ([#40])
- The minimum supported Rust version is declared and checked in CI. It is
  **1.92** — the floor the egui 0.34 stack imposes. The README had claimed
  1.75, and the field had been unset. ([#31], [#40])

### Added

- **`--ui-tour DIR`** (hidden): walks every screen, captures each through
  egui's own screenshot command, and exits — so the README screenshots can be
  regenerated consistently. The affinity, nice and I/O-priority dialogs are
  not covered; they are separate OS windows the glow backend will not
  screenshot. ([#28])

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-02

### Added

- In-app update check and self-install from GitHub releases. ([#27])

## [1.0.9] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Icons redrawn as tiered vector masters; icon size is no longer hardcoded, so
  small sizes stop turning to mush. ([#25])

### Changed

- Settings tab finished against its mockup. ([#26])

## [1.0.8] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- The design package implemented against its actual mockups. ([#24])

## [1.0.7] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Rendering defects found by running the redesigned UI. ([#23])

## [1.0.6] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- The whole UI redesigned against the design handoff spec. ([#22])

## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-31

### Changed

- Design round 2: heatmap cells, quick-filter chips, light-theme contrast.
- Design pass over navigation, the notification centre, the kill toast and the
  layout system.
- README brought up to date with the new features and UI.

## [1.0.4] — 2026-07-31

### Added

- cgroup v2 ProBalance backend, opt-in. See `docs/design-cgroup-probalance.md`.

### Fixed

- Seven defects from review of the preceding feature rounds.

## [1.0.3] — 2026-07-30

### Added

- Per-process GPU%, automatic game detection, a persistent log, and
  `status --json`.
- Process details window, Overview disk and network graphs, regex filtering.
- Column chooser, daemon unit tests, and an AUR PKGBUILD.

### Fixed

- Eight defects found reviewing the new feature code.
- `status --json` rounded `cpu_percent` as f64 to avoid f32 noise.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-07-30

### Added

- pkexec install path, "remember settings" rules, and power profiles.

### Fixed

- CPU graph area fill.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-30

### Added

- Dependabot, a security-audit workflow, and a tag-triggered release workflow
  building both x86_64 and aarch64.

### Fixed

- Twenty-four bugs found in a deep code review.
- A single-instance lock, so two instances stop clobbering each other's config.

### Performance

- Virtualized the process table; dropped per-frame clones and sysfs reads.
